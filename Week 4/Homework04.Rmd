```{Question 1}
# Suppose you own stocks and watch the stock market every day, write a function in R named
# “stock_advice” to tell you whether you should sell your stocks under the following conditions
# using if-else conditional statements:
# • If the stock market value from today is lower than that from the average of the past 3 days,
# return “buy”
# • If the stock market value from today is higher than that from the average of the past 3 days,
# return “sell”
# • If the stock market value from today is the same as the average of the past 3 days, return
# “watch”
# Include 4 arguments in your function: today’s value, day 1 value, day 2 value and day 3 value.
# Note: to get the average of the past 3 days, use (day1+day2+day3)/3
# Find the predicted decision if today’s stock market value is $12.11, and the last 3 days values are
# $10.39, $15.98, and $13.96.

stock_advice <- function(today, day1, day2, day3) {
  average_past_3_days <- (day1 + day2 + day3) / 3
  
  if (today < average_past_3_days) {
    return("buy")
  } else if (today > average_past_3_days) {
    return("sell")
  } else {
    return("watch")
  }
}

today_value <- 12.11
day1_value <- 10.39
day2_value <- 15.98
day3_value <- 13.96

decision <- stock_advice(today_value, day1_value, day2_value, day3_value)
print(decision)

```{Question 2}
# Let x be a vector of (3,6,12,17,19,33,24,21,10,8,5). Use a for loop and a conditional statement to do the following:
# If the x current element value is less than 15, then update that element with its current value-1.
# (e.g. if the current x value is 3, then update it with 2). If the x current element value is larger than
# or equal to 15, then no change will be made, and keep the current value.

x <- c(3, 6, 12, 17, 19, 33, 24, 21, 10, 8, 5)

for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  if (x[i] < 15) {
    x[i] <- x[i] - 1
  }
}

```{Question 3}
# Enter the data from the following table with three variables to create a 
# data frame
# Name Education Salary
# Jack Master 20000
# Jerry Master 20000
# Emma Master 20000
# Andy Bachelor 30000
# Jayde Bachelor 10000

print(df)

# Use a loop and conditional statement to do the following:
# a. if the education level is Bachelor, increase the salary by 1000
# b. if the education level is Master, increase the salary by 2000
# c. if the education level is Ph.D. increase the salary by 3000

# Loop through each row of the data frame

```{Question 4}
# Suppose that you have a dataset with 8 individuals recording the blood 
# pressure at baseline and
# a follow-up. Your goal is to show the correct treatment for these 8
# individuals. The rule is: if the
# baseline>follow-up, then the patient is recovered, and the treatment
# should show “no treatment
# needed”; if the baseline<follow-up, the treatment needs to show “more
# treatment needed”; and
# if baseline=follow-up, then the treatment is “to be determined”. Create a
# vector of baseline and
# a vector of follow-up with the data in the following table. Use a loop and
# conditional statement
# to show the appropriate treatment. Please do NOT create any function.
# Patient 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
# Baseline 100 110 109 99 103 101 125 130
# Follow-up 105 100 102 105 100 97 108 120

# Create vectors for baseline and follow-up data
baseline <- c(100, 110, 109, 99, 103, 101, 125, 130)
follow_up <- c(105, 100, 102, 105, 100, 97, 108, 120)

# Initialize an empty vector to store treatment information
treatment <- vector()

# Loop through each individual's data
for (i in 1:length(baseline)) {
  # Check the condition and assign treatment accordingly
  if (baseline[i] > follow_up[i]) {
    treatment[i] <- "no treatment needed"

# Print the treatment vector

```{Question 5}
# Write a double for-loop function to calculate the sum of all numbers in a
# matrix. The code on
# our lecture slide 20 is a good reference for this question. Suppose the
# matrix is
# 𝐴 = 
# (
# 36 51 40
# 39 78 62
# 22 37 52
# )
# Run the function with matrix A.

calculate_matrix_sum <- function(matrix) {
  # Initialize a variable to store the sum
  total_sum <- 0
  
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in 1:nrow(matrix)) {
    # Loop through columns
    for (j in 1:ncol(matrix)) {
      # Add each element to the total sum
      total_sum <- total_sum + matrix[i, j]
    }

  # Return the total sum
  return(total_sum)
