## Complete the activities mentioned in the videos

```{r Part 01 Slide 20}
# Everything copied and pasted from slide 20:
# Example

# df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
# df <- df %>%mutate(c = a + b)
# df

# perform multiple operations in a single mutate() call
# df <- df %>%
#   mutate(
#   c = a + b,
#   d = a * 2,
#   e = b/2
#   )
# print(df)

```

```{r Part 01 Slide 21}
# Everything copied and pasted from slide 20:
# Overwrite existing columns:

# df <- df %>%
#   mutate(a = a * 100)
# print(df)

# Using helper functions: dplyr provides several helper functions that can be used inside mutate(). For
# instance, if_else() can be useful for conditional changes:

# df <- df %>%
#   mutate(f = if_else(a > 200, "High", "Low"))
# print(df)
```

```{r Part 01 Slide 22}
# Example:
# 1. use the Orange data, 
#Choose the trees with circumference >100
# Add a column to show the unit circumference using circumference/age 
#(name that variable ad unitc)
# Save the changes as new data NewOrange

# NewOrange<-Orange%>%
#   filter(circumference>100)%>%
#   mutate(unitc = circumference/age)
# print(NewOrange)

# Use the InsectSprays data, and add a new column “Odor” to re-group the sprays: If the spray
# is A, B or C, group them as group LowOdor, otherwise call the spray High odor. Use the ifelse
# function to do this.

# library(tidyverse)

# InsectSprays%>%
#   mutate(Odor=ifelse( spray %in% c("A", "B", "C"), "LowOdor", "HighOdor"))

```

```{r Part 01 Slide 23 Activity 02}
# use the flights data from the nycflights13 package
# Choose the flights in January, from JFK to MSP
# Select the variables: dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay, air_time, and
#distance
# Add a column to show the speed of selected flights: speed=distance/ air time
# Create a new file “newflight” to save the above changes

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# Filter flights from JFK to MSP in January
january_flights <- filter(flights, month == 1, origin == "JFK", dest == "MSP")

# Select required variables

```{r Part 01 Slide 24}
# Package: “dplyr”
# The arrange() function is used to reorder rows of a dataframe by column values.

# data %>% arrange(variablename)

# Default: sort by ascending order
# If want to sort by descending order, use desc(variable)

```

```{r Part 01 Slide 25}
# Example:Assume you have a dataframe df with columns A and B
df <- data.frame(A = c(3, 1, 4), B = c(6, 5, 7))
#  arrange df by column A in ascending order as:
arrange(df, A) 
# OR 
df %>% arrange(A)
# Descending order: If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the desc()
# function:
arrange(df, desc(A)) 
# OR
df %>%arrange(desc(A))
# Sorting by multiple columns: If you want to sort by multiple columns, simply add the
# columns in the order you want:
arrange(df, A, B) 
# OR 
df %>% arrange(A,B)
# This will first sort by column A and then by column B for rows with the same values of 
```

```{r Part 01 Slide 26}
# Example: Sort the OrangeNew data by circumference

# NewOrange%>%
#   arrange(circumference)
```

```{r Part 01-02 Slide 27 Activity 03}
# Activity 03
# Use the newflight data created from the previous activity
# Sort by the arrival delay time
# Generate an appropriate graph to see the relationship between arrival
# delay and speed
# Is there a strong correlation?

# Load the previously created CSV file into R
newflight <- read.csv("newflight.csv")

```{r Part 02 Slide 28}
# Package: “dplyr”
# group_by()
# The group_by() function groups data by one or more columns.
# The result is a grouped data frame, but it looks almost the same as the original data
# frame.
# The difference becomes apparent when you use it with other dplyr verbs.
data <- data.frame(
  Category = c('A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B'),

```{r Part 02 Slide 29}
# Package: “dplyr”
# summarize()
# The summarize() function is used to compute summary statistics for each group.
# It can be used with any function that returns a single value (like mean, sum, min, etc.).
# When you use summarize() on a grouped data frame, it computes the summary
# statistics for each group and returns a new data frame.
# Example:
summary_data <- grouped_data %>%
  summarize(
    Total = sum(Value),
    Average = mean(Value)
  )
summary_data

```

```{r Part 02 Slide 30}
# group_by() and summarize()
# group_by() and summarize() usually go together
# Example:
data %>%
group_by(Category) %>%
  summarize(
    Total = sum(Value),
    Average = mean(Value)
  )
# Example:
# Use the InsectSprays data to get the mean count of each spray, and plot the
# means using a bar chart.

```{r Part 02 Slide 31}
# Values of NA is considered as missing values
# If there are missing values, we can’t find the mean
# To find the descriptive statistics without missing values:

# filter(!is.na(variable)) %>%
#   group_by(...) %>%
#   summarize(average=mean(variable))

# OR

# filter(!is.na(variable) %>%
# group_by() %>%
# summarize(total=n())

```{r Part 02 Slide 32}
# Example: Use the mpg data to do the following
# Keep all the none NA’s from the hwy, and find the average highway
# miles per gallon by manufacturer. Which manufacturer has the
# highest highway miles per gallon?
# Group by manufacturer and find the total number of each
# manufacturer of cars. (there is no missing value of manufacturer, so no
