```{r Question 1}
# What does the following function return? Why? 
# (Write comments in your RMarkdown file with a 
# couple of sentences to explain why you obtained such an output).

F1<-function(x=2, y=0) {
  x+y
}
F1(3,4)

# the function takes two parameters, x and y, and it calculates 
# the sum of them and returns the result. 
# F1(3,4) overrides the default values, x and y, and it 
# calculates the sum of 3 and 4.
```

```{r Question 2}
# What does the following function return? Why? (Write comments 
# in your RMarkdown file to explain why your output is like that)
l<-function (x){
result<-x+1
return(result)
}
m<-function(){
l<-function(x) {
result<-x*2
return(result)
}
l(10)
}
m()

# The first function is defined with one parameter, x. In it, it # calculates the sum of x and 1 and returns the result.
# The second function, m, is defined. Inside m, there is a local # function, l, defined again, which has a different 
# implementation than the first l. The local l function takes 
# a parameter, x, and calculates result as the product of x and 
# 2. Then, it returns the result.
# Finally, the m function calls the local l function, with 10 as 
# the argument. Therefore, m() returns the result, of calling the # local l(10).

```

```{r Question 3}
# Create a function in R to calculate the T statistic for the 
# one-sample T-test
# T = (𝑥̅ - 𝜇)/(s/SQRTn)
# Where
# 𝑥̅ = sample mean, ("x bar")
# 𝜇 = population mean,
# s = sample standard deviation
# n = sample size.
# Suppose the input arguments are 𝒙̅, 𝝁, 𝒔 and 𝒏
# Call your function with the inputs: 𝒙̅=2.1, 𝝁=1, 𝒔=0.5, n=50

# Function to calculate T statistic for one-sample T-test
calculate_T_statistic <- function(x_bar, mu, s, n) {
  t_statistic <- (x_bar - mu) / (s / sqrt(n))
  return(t_statistic)
}

# Input arguments
x_bar <- 2.1
mu <- 1
s <- 0.5
n <- 50

# Call the function
result <- calculate_T_statistic(x_bar, mu, s, n)

# Print the result
cat("T statistic:", result, "\n")

```

```{r Question 4}
# Your collaborator tells you that you can use the length of the # hindfoot to calculate brain volume.
# Apparently, the hindfoot of these creatures is equal to the 
# diameter of their skulls. Write a function that will calculate # the volume of the animals’ skulls. The formula for the volume 
# of a sphere is (4∗𝜋∗𝑟^3)/3 , where r is the radius of the 
# skull.
# Include one input: d being the diameter of the skull.
# Call the function with the inputs: 𝒅 = 𝟓, where 𝑑 is the
# diameter (hindfoot) of a skull.

# Function to calculate volume of animal's skull
calculate_skull_volume <- function(d) {
  # Calculate the radius from the diameter
  r <- d / 2
  
  # Calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a sphere
  volume <- (4 * pi * r^3) / 3
  
  return(volume)
}

# Input diameter
d <- 5  # replace with the actual hindfoot diameter

# Call the function
skull_volume <- calculate_skull_volume(d)

# Print the result
cat("Volume of the animal's skull:", skull_volume, "\n")

```

```{r Question 5}
# Create a function to find the center of mass for two masses, 
# with four parameters (input or arguments) being m1, m2, x1 and # x2, where m1 and m2 are the mass of the two and x1 and x2
# are the locations of the two masses. The following figure 
# showed the calculation of the center of
# two masses

# x_cm = (m_1*x_1 + m_2*x_2)/(m_1 + m_2)

# Call the function with the inputs: 𝑚_1 = 2, 𝑚_2 = 5, 𝑥_1 = 3, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥_2 = 10

# Function to calculate the center of mass for two masses
calculate_center_of_mass <- function(m1, m2, x1, x2) {
  # Calculate the center of mass using the formula
  x_cm <- (m1 * x1 + m2 * x2) / (m1 + m2)
  
  return(x_cm)
}

# Input parameters
m1 <- 2
m2 <- 5
x1 <- 3
x2 <- 10

# Call the function
center_of_mass <- calculate_center_of_mass(m1, m2, x1, x2)

# Print the result
cat("Center of mass:", center_of_mass, "\n")
