## Question 01
```{r Question 01}
# Open R Markdown

```

## Question 02
```{r Question 02}
# Create R data structure:

# a) Create and print a numeric vector
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 12, 20)
x

# b) Create and print a character vector
y <- c("red", "yellow", "blue")
y

# c) Create and print a list, z.
z <- list(a = x, b = y)
z

# d) Convert the vector y in b) to a factor
y_factor <- factor(y)
y_factor

```

## Question 03
```{r Question 03}
# Create a function named triangle_identifier with the following requirements:

# a) Have three inputs (arguments): x1, x2, and x3. The x1, x2, and x3 are the 
#    lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
triangle_identifier <- function(x1, x2, x3) {
  # stub
}

# b) Include if-else statements in the function to show whether the x1, x2 and 
#    x3 can create a triangle.
#    • If x1+x2<x3, then it is not a triangle.
#    • If x1+x3<x2, then it is not a triangle.
#    • If x2+x3<x1, then it is not a triangle.
#    • Otherwise, it is a triangle.
#    Return the result of whether it is a triangle.
triangle_identifier <- function(x1, x2, x3) {
  if (x1 + x2 < x3 || x1 + x3 < x2 || x2 + x3 < x1) {
    result <- "It is not a triangle"
  } else {
    result <- "It is a triangle"
  }
  return(result)
}

# c) Call the function using x1=3, x2=5, x3=6 and print the output; and call the
#    function using x1=2, x2=3, x3=7 and print the output.
output1 <- triangle_identifier(3, 5, 6)

## Question 04
```{r Question 04}
# The data Cholesterol on D2L recorded 49 high cholesterol patients’ cholesterol 
# levels after taking different medications. Among those 49 patients, some of 
# them were assigned to take the placebo, some were assigned to take the 
# low-dosage medication, and the rest took high dosages.

# press "Import Dataset" -> press "From Excel..." -> press "Browse..." -> 
# navigate & select .xlsx file -> copy (command + c) code from "Code Preview:" 
# -> press "Import" -> paste (command + v) code to the RStudio Integrated 
# Development Environment.
Cholesterol <- read_excel("/Users/peytonhall/Desktop/Data211Midterm/Cholesterol.xlsx")
# View(Cholesterol)

# a) Use ggplot() to generate an appropriate graph to show the five-number 
#    summary of cholesterol levels at each medication group. Label the x-axis as 
#    “Medication group” and y as “Cholesterol levels.” 
#    Color the inside red and the borders black.
ggplot(Cholesterol, aes(x = Dosage, y = Chol)) + 
  labs(x = "Medication group", y = "Cholesterol levels") + # labels
  geom_boxplot(fill = "red", color = "black") # red insides & black borders

# b) Is there any outlier in a)?
# Answer:
#    I see one outlier in a. That is, one of the patients on placebo had a 210 
#    cholesterol level. The 210 cholesterol level differs from the average 
#    cholesterol level in patients on placebo. This outlier can be observed in 
#    the boxplot by the dot in the placebo column on the x axis. 

# c) Use ggplot() to generate an appropriate graph to show the distribution of 
#    all cholesterol levels regardless of medication groups, with 20 bins. Label 
#    the x axis as “Cholesterol levels”. Color the border with red and the 
#    inside of the bars with yellow.
#    create a histogram because bars are required
ggplot(Cholesterol, aes(x = Chol)) +
  labs(x = "Cholesterol levels") + # label the x axis
  geom_histogram(fill = "yellow", color = "red", bins = 20) # red border

```

## Question 05
```{r Question 05}
# Create the following table as a data frame 
# and complete the following questions:

# a) Create the data frame with the name PatientInfo and print it
#    PatientID, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
#    A,         90,                             120
#    B,         98,                             135
#    C,         76,                             109

  Systolic_Blood_Pressure_SBP = c(120, 135, 109, 141)
)
PatientInfo

# b) Use rbind() to add one row of new individuals with the information: 
#    PatientID: E
#    Diastolic Blood Pressure: 118
#    Systolic Blood Pressure: 129.
#    Name the new data frame with the new E as BloodPressure and print it.

  Systolic_Blood_Pressure_SBP = 129
)
BloodPressure <- rbind(PatientInfo, new_individual) # row bind adds the new row
BloodPressure # print the updated result

# c) Add a new column named Age to the above data frame (BloodPressure) 
#    and name the new data frame as NewPatientInfo. 
#    Following are the data in column Age: 28, 35,42, 40, 39.
Age <- c(28, 35, 42, 40, 39)
BloodPressure$Age <- Age # adds a new column
NewPatientInfo <- BloodPressure # assigns new data to a new data frame

# b) Generate a time series plot with the axis being a month and the 
#    axis being milk per cow and use color to show different years.
